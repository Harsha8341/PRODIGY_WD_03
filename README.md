This repository contains the source code for a Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Overview
The Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to compete by taking turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game. This application can also be extended to include an AI opponent.

Features
Interactive 3x3 grid for gameplay

Click handling to mark cells

Game state tracking to manage turns and moves

Logic to check for winning conditions or a draw

Option to play against another player or an AI opponent (optional)

Technologies Used
HTML for structuring the game board and interface

CSS for styling the board and user interface

JavaScript for game logic, event handling, and state management

How to Run
Clone the repository or download the source files.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Start playing by clicking on the cells of the grid.

How It Works
Players alternate clicking on empty cells.

Each click updates the game state and displays the player's mark (X or O).

After each move, the application checks if there is a winner or if the game ends in a draw.

When the game ends, the application notifies the players and optionally allows restarting the game.

Customization
You can extend the application by:

Adding an AI opponent with basic or advanced strategies.

Improving the UI and animations.

Adding score tracking and game history.
